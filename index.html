        My first career as an IT consultant/sysadmin/network engineer was made possible by high-quality freeware generously developed by volunteers.
        I try to return the favor when I have ideas for easy-to-use, cross-platform utilities that ought to already exist.
        I prefer single-file executables (or <code>.app</code> bundles on Mac) when possible so they can be carried on a flash drive and don't require installers.

            <p class="description">Wireless, encrypted file transfer over automatically configured ad hoc networking. No network infrastructure required (access point, router, switch).
            Just two laptops with wireless chips in close range.
            Don't have a flash drive? Don't have access to a wireless network or don't trust one?
            Need to move a file larger than 2GB between different filesystems but don't want to set up a file share? Try it out!
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer multiple files at once, without losing progress if the transfer is interrupted or canceled.</li>
                <li>Speeds over 120mbps (with laptops close together).</li>
                <li>Does not use Bluetooth or your local network, just wireless chip to wireless chip.</li>
                <li>Files encrypted in transit.</li>
                <li>Large files supported (&lt10MB RAM usage while transferring a 4.5GB file).</li>
                <li>No installation required and no dependencies needed.</li>
                <li>Interoperable GUI and CLI versions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="description">Have you ever wanted to protect a file with a password and found it unnecessarily difficult to do so?
            Cloaker aims to provide the easiest, simplest file encryption possible. Just drop a file onto the window,
            set a password, and choose where to save it. To decrypt, drop the encrypted file on the window,
            enter the password, and choose the output location. (Tip: decrypt to a ramdisk for temporary use to avoid
            writing data to permanent storage.) No installation required! On Windows it's a single .exe, on Mac a standard
            <code>.app</code> bundle, and on Linux a single executable <code>.run</code> file.
